  This plugin can...

  * Run a specified shell command on an entire buffer.
  * Run a specified shell command for a selection.
  * Watch for changes in the buffer and run a shell command automatically.

Other than the installation steps, this plugin requires no additional configuration to get started. When <Leader>r or :WatchBuffer is run, the plugin will ask for the shell command to associate with the current buffer.

A lot of things in the plugin are configurable including the events which trigger the live preview. This plugin can also remember the entered shell command for future use.

Check out the Github page for more details with screenshots.
